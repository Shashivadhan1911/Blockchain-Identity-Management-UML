## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains comprehensive UML design documentation for a **Blockchain-based Identity Management System** developed as part of Software Engineering coursework. The project demonstrates the application of software engineering principles and UML modeling techniques to design a decentralized identity solution that leverages blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and user-controlled digital identity management.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Design a conceptual decentralized identity management system using blockchain technology
- Apply software engineering principles and UML modeling techniques
- Create comprehensive system documentation through various UML diagrams
- Demonstrate theoretical understanding of blockchain architecture and identity management concepts
- Provide a well-documented design for a scalable and secure digital identity solution
- Collaborate effectively as a team to deliver complete system design documentation

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The blockchain identity management system is designed with the following key components:

### Core Components
- **Identity Registry**: Smart contracts managing identity records on the blockchain
- **Verification System**: Multi-factor authentication and identity verification mechanisms
- **User Interface**: Web and mobile applications for user interaction
- **Blockchain Network**: Distributed ledger for storing identity credentials
- **Cryptographic Module**: Encryption and digital signature management
- **Access Control**: Permission-based access to identity information

### Key Features
- **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: Users have complete control over their digital identities
- **Decentralized Storage**: Identity data stored across distributed blockchain network
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof identity credentials and transaction history
- **Privacy Protection**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure capabilities
- **Interoperability**: Standards-compliant implementation for cross-platform compatibility
- **Revocation Management**: Secure credential revocation and status management

## üìä UML Diagrams

This repository includes comprehensive UML documentation covering all aspects of the system design:

### Structural Diagrams
- **Class Diagrams**: System components, relationships, and data structures
- **Component Diagrams**: High-level system architecture and component interactions
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure and deployment configuration

### Behavioral Diagrams
- **Use Case Diagrams**: System functionality and user interactions
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Message flow and interaction patterns
- **Activity Diagrams**: Business processes and workflow management
- **State Diagrams**: Object lifecycle and state transitions

## üîß Technology Stack

### Blockchain Technologies
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity/Ethereum or similar blockchain platform
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof of Authority (PoA) or Proof of Stake (PoS)
- **Storage**: IPFS for distributed file storage
- **Cryptography**: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)

### Development Tools
- **UML Modeling**: Visual Paradigm, Lucidchart, or PlantUML
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Documentation**: Markdown and automated documentation tools

## üèÜ Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases
1. **User Registration**: New user identity creation and blockchain registration
2. **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication and identity proof
3. **Credential Issuance**: Digital credential creation and blockchain storage
4. **Identity Sharing**: Selective disclosure of identity information
5. **Credential Verification**: Third-party verification of user credentials
6. **Identity Recovery**: Account recovery and backup mechanisms
7. **Credential Revocation**: Secure revocation of compromised credentials

### Actors
- **End Users**: Individuals managing their digital identities
- **Verifiers**: Organizations requiring identity verification
- **Issuers**: Authorities issuing digital credentials
- **System Administrators**: Platform maintenance and monitoring
- **Auditors**: Compliance and security audit personnel
